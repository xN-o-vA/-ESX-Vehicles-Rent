 --/ Information /--
-- x, y, z, h -> vehicle coordinates
-- model -> Car model
-- price -> Price per minute car rental (if "false" then rent is free)
-- job -> The name of the fraction only she can rent a transport(If "none" then everyone can rent a transpo)

--/ Not a bug but a feature /--
-- When a player gets in a car that he has not rented for others,
-- he disappears, if this is removed, the player will endlessly fall
-- under the map for others, although for himself everything will be in order.

--/ There are no bugs /-- 
-- Sometimes the rented car stops opening and closing, as I understand what
-- the problem will be fixed (but this is not accurate)
